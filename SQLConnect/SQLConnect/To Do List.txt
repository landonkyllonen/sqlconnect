Implement proper message encryption: (SQLConnectPage.cs & ComposeMessagePage.cs & MessagesTab.cs)
	Right now everyone has same auth, secure over connection, but not with unwanted db access.
	Solution: Retrieve recipient's auth when sending, needs to be done in c#, can't send unencrypted details to php.
				As a bonus, keep auth for decryption in two parts, one part static in c#, other part unique to every user on db.
				This way, access to db cannot give whole key to decryption.

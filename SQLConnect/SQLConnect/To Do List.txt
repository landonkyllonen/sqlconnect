Implement proper message encryption: (SQLConnectPage.cs & ComposeMessagePage.cs & MessagesTab.cs)
	Right now everyone has same auth, secure over connection, but not with unwanted db access.
	Solution: Retrieve recipient's auth when sending, needs to be done in c#, can't send unencrypted details to php.
				As a bonus, keep auth for decryption in two parts, one part static in c#, other part unique to every user on db.
				This way, access to db cannot give whole key to decryption.

Change auths in db. Change meds in db.

Implement phps and format default values once able to access ftp and SQL. Get products working again.
